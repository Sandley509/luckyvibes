<br>10.2 We reserve the right to refuse or cancel any bet, or part thereof, before the game starts and to make ambiguous bets void, without providing justification.

Integrity of the event has been called into question or
Match fixing has taken place
the price has been manipulated;
an individual or individuals are suspected of acting either in conspiracy or concert; and/or
changes in venue and/or starting time of events,
We reserve the right to withhold payment and to declare bets void. In order to identify such events, the Group will review evidence, including but not limited to, size, volume or patterns across all or any of the channels

A number of bets that contain the same single selection may be treated as being one. When this occurs all bets may be voided apart from the first bet struck. An example would be where 1 particular selection is repeatedly included in Multiple bets involving other short-priced selections.

Your Luckyvibes account balance is divided into a cash balance, bonus balance and a free bet.
When your account is credited with promotional bonus credits, these credits will be added to your bonus balance.
Casino Welcome Bonuses are subject to 40x play-through requirements.
Casino Bonus amounts credited to your bonus balance are subject to 40x to 50x play-through requirements, before they can be withdrawn.
If you do not want a promotion bonus that has been deposited into your bonus balance by Luckyvibes, you may request to have that promotion bonus removed from your bonus balance. Such a request can be made by email or telephone. If any play-through of a promotion bonus has taken place, then that promotion bonus may not be removed from your account until the play-through requirements associated with that promotion bonus have been met.
Where the payment of a bonus under the terms of any promotion is dependent on you making a deposit into your cash balance and you withdraw all or part of the deposit before the bonus is paid into your bonus balance, you will forfeit the bonus in question and any winnings won using the bonus.
If, prior to meeting the full play-through requirements, your bonus balance drops below $1 and provided there are no bets in play at the time, then your play-through requirements will be considered to have been met. For example, bets in play may include any un-played Free Spins waiting on a slot game, a bet waiting to end on a blackjack table or an incomplete token game (a token game is one in which a player needs to earn tokens or tickets to complete an achievement). The following are considered token games: Tribal Treasure, Chief’s Fortune, Tomb Raider™ – Secret of the Sword, Wealth Spa, Scrooge and Castle Builder™).
Play-through on games will count towards the play-through requirement. However, different types of games will contribute differently towards meeting the play-through requirement. The contributing percentages are as follows:
 Sports betting	Casino	Live Casino <br>
Sports betting       0%	Most slots and parlor games (Keno and scratch card games)	100%	Sic Bo
 	50%
 	Table Games and Casino War	20%	Baccarat, Craps, Blackjack	10%
 	Texas Hold'em Bonus Poker, Sic Bo, Wheel of Riches and all roulette games. Video poker games, craps, baccarat and all blackjack games except Classic Blackjack. Hot Ink, Retro Reels (Extreme Heat/Diamond Glitz)	10%	Roulette	2%

Casino irregular play is deemed when Luckyvibes detects unnatural player betting patterns. Irregular play includes, but is not limited to, any one or more of the following types of play:  
Any irregular play will result in immediate disqualification from a bonus and the casino reserves the rights to withhold any withdrawals and/or confiscate all winnings. Any repeat offence of irregular play may result in your exclusion, deregistration or suspension from the casino.
Placing single bets equal to or in excess of 15% of the value of the bonus before the play-through requirements for that bonus have been met.
Using the double-up feature to increase bet values. <br>
Placing high-value bets with the single intention of increasing your balance, thereafter proceeding to place bets of less than half of the prior bet value, while reasonably not decreasing your bankroll, in order to meet bonus play-through requirements.
Even money bets on Sic Bo, craps, baccarat, Wheel of Riches and roulette.
Employing a strategy by which high-value bets are placed on any game with play-through contribution weightings less than 30% (any table games, card games, video poker, etc.) and then proceeding to place bets of less than half of the prior average bet value while changing game type to higher-weighted games (slots, casual games, scratch cards, etc.).

<br>
Percentage Tracking Mode Bonus System
The following bonus mode will apply for Casino:
All bets and wins are deducted from or added to your balance, in proportion to the split of your cash and bonus balances at the time of placing the bet.
For example:
If you deposit 100 credits and you qualify for and receive a bonus of 100 credits, your balance will be 200 credits. Your balance will be split – 50% in your cash balance and 50% in your bonus balance. In order to meet your wager requirement of 40x on the casino games, deleted the money wagered will equate to half from your cash balance and half from your bonus balance. Should you place a bet of 10 credits, 5 credits will be used from your cash balance and 5 credits from your bonus balance. Any winnings accrued will be allocated in the same manner (50% of your winnings will be allocated to your cash balance and the other 50% will be allocated to your bonus balance).

<br>
If not used, the Free Bet will expire 7 days after being credited (unless specified otherwise).
The Free Bet must be used in its entirety as a single transaction/bet.
The Free Bet cannot be used to place multi-line multiple bets (e.g. Trixie’s, Patents, Yankees etc.)
Should the Free Bet be placed on a selection that is later voided, the stakes will be returned to your account as a Free Bet.
The Free Bet is non-refundable and the Free Bet stake is not included in any returns.
The maximum return on any Free Bet stake is $5,000.
Placement of a Free Bet on an each-way market is considered one bet (including the win and place portion). The return from this bet must be greater than the total value of the Free Bet placed for winnings to be paid out.
